        <h2>how to make this delicious chicken taco lasagna</h2>

        <p>Unlike other Mexican lasagnas that use tortillas, this one actually uses lasagna noodles making it a true lasagna.<br>
            I like the one with tortillas too but to me those are called layered enchiladas.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>


            <li>reheat oven to 350 degrees.
            <li>In a large skillet, brown beef until no longer pink. Drain meat and add the taco seasoning. Stir until combined and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, add the egg and ricotta and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>In a 9x13 baking dish, start by layering 4 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan. Next, layer 1/3 of the ricotta, 1/3 of the beef mixture, 1/3 of the salsa, and 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat the layers 2 more times.</li>
            <li>Bake covered for 30-40 minutes or until the casserole has heated through and is bubbly. Let casserole stand 10 minutes before cutting. Top with sour cream, sliced green onions, and diced tomatoes if desired.</li>
